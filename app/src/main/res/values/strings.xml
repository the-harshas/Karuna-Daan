      Tax Deduction under Section 80G
        Under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act, donations made to eligible NGOs can qualify for a tax deduction of 50% of the donated
        amount, encouraging individuals and corporations to support impactful social initiatives.

    To avail your tax deductions under Section 80G, it’s important to confirm that the NGO is registered under this section (80G).
        However, as per tax regulations, no deduction is allowed for cash donations exceeding ₹2000 (source: incometax.gov.in, 2024).
        Donations to CRY India, for instance, can be conveniently made through multiple channels, including digital wallets, UPI, credit/debit card points redemption, and even legacy giving.

    Social Responsibility
        Supporting an NGO goes beyond financial benefits; it demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility. Through tax-exempt donations, you’re not only helping underserved communities but also aligning with responsible citizenship.
        CRY India uses contributions to empower children with education, healthcare, and better living conditions.
